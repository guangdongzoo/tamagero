# tamagero v1.0
A tamagotchi game made for the Arduboy.

# summary
This is a small hobby project that I made over the past week. It's a basic tamagotchi clone with a few characters, but the basic version is functional and can be flashed to the device. I may make occassional patches but I don't expect this to be an ongoing project.
It was mildly frustrating to start learning this platform, so thanks to my friends on Discord who watched me live stream my frustration. In particular, Dan helped me with a few agonizing technicalities so Iâ€™m extremely grateful.

# gameplay
*Tamagero* are virtual pets that need care and affection to survive. To be in good health, they must be **fed**, **cleaned** and **played with** frequently. This version is meant to be played passively, checking in on your tamagero every 20 minutes or so. If your tamagero is too hungry or dirty, it may run away. If it bored, it may become disobedient. 

Tamagero passively aqcuire Xp. If your tamagero is having lots of fun, then it may acquire Xp faster! With more experience, your tamagero may level up.

Money is required to feed, clean and buy new tamagero. Money is obtained primarily through leveling up, but in a future update there maybe be some additional features. To make this not be a burden, the money system is pretty generous right now.

There are 25 standard tamagero in total. I hope that you enjoy all of them.
