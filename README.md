# tamagero
A tamagotchi game made for the Arduboy.

# summary
I made this project to pass the time during quarantine and to pay tribute to the Tamagotchi-esque electronics popular throughout the 90s and 2000s. I give my thanks to my friend Dan who helped me extensively in debugging, and to my Discord friends who provided me with aesthetic ideas.
